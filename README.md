# ids
tool for intrusion detection system 
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an app that analyzes inbound and outward network traffic continuously, analyzing for activity changes and patterns. It notifies an administrator when it detects unusual
behavior. For instance, an IDS might inspect the data carried by network traffic to see if it contains known malware or other dangerous information. If it detects such a threat, it sends an alert to the security team
to investigate and take appropriate action
